repository contains the source code and configuration files for a Data Visualization App built with Angular and Docker-Compose. The app is designed to visualize and analyze data in a user-friendly manner.\nPrerequisites\nBefore running the application, make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:\n\nDocker\nDocker-Compose\nNode.js\n\nGetting Started\n\nClone the repository:\nExample :git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-visualization-app.git\ncd data-visualization-app\nInstall Angular CLI globally:\nExample :npm install -g @angular/cli\nInstall project dependencies:\nExample :npm install\nBuild the Angular app:\nExample :ng build\nStart the Docker containers:\nExample :docker-compose up -d\nOpen your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the Data Visualization App.\n\n\nProject Structure\n\nsrc/: Contains the Angular application source code.\ndocker-compose.yml: Configuration file for Docker-Compose.\nDockerfile: Dockerfile for building the Angular app image.\n\nDocker-Compose Configuration\nThe docker-compose.yml file defines the services, networks, and volumes needed for the application.
